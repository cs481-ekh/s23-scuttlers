## Abstract
Artificial Intelligence has become a major field in Computer Science. The sponsor wishes to be
provided a game that can be used as an educational tool to introduce players to AI concepts. This
game must use object-oriented design patterns in order to be easily extensible so that he, or others,
can add to the project in the future with minimal effort.

This project will provide the sponsor with Antscuttle, a top-down-pixel simulator. In the game,
players will be given a scenario and, using their limited options for a level, design ants and decision
trees that will complete the level. Completing a level may involve solving an environmental puzzle
and/or defeating enemies. This gives the player a simple introduction to AI-related concepts while,
hopefully, keeping their interest.

A secondary goal was to design the game to make it easy for a developer to add new armors, weapons,
characters, and decision blocks. We chose to use an open source license to promote accessibility of
the code. The idea is that a developer should be able to add new items to the game with as little 
effort as possible, and without having to change much game code (if any).

## Project Description

TBD (what we actually built, how it works, include screenshots)

## Build
To build the project from the main directory:
```
./build.sh
```

The build provides a fat jar, which will work apart from the codebase. It can be run using:
```
java -jar antscuttle-1.5-all.jar
```

### Build / Run Requirements
Java JDK 11+

### Build Status
